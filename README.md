# DDD (Domain-driven Design)

It is a software design methodology. A way to mantain very clear and standardized communication between all parties involved in the development of an application. 

## Domain

An are of understanding where all people involved in building the software have very similar knowledge.

- **Domain Experts:** these are the people who deeply understand the problem we are solving with our software.
  - **Conversation:** is the first thing that is very important in development of a software. From the conversation you will have more knowledge of the domain, this being the area of understanding in which you are developing software. From these conversations, a ubiquitous language will be created.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** or domain language, is an universal language in which all people involved in building that software can communicate equally.
- **Aggregates:**
- **Value Objects:**
- **Domain Events:**
- **Bounded Contexts:**
- **Entities:** is everything I can understand as something that will be maintained by our user or by our application. Entities are usually found in our conversations with domain experts.
- **Use Cases:** are the verbs that I found in our conversations with domain experts.
